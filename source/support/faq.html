<h1>thingSoC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<ul class="faq">
  <li>Q: What is <b>thingSoC</b>?</li>
  <li><b>thingSoC</b> is an open source standard that defines a
vendor independent socket system for the creation of new Internet Things;
it addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings
and standards, by adding capabilities such as automatic device discovery, 
automatic device configuration, self-monitoring, and self-testing.</li>

  <li>Q: Is <b>thingSoC</b> hardware, firmware, or software?
  </li>
  <li><b>thingSoC</b> defines both a physical, hardware socket system for interoperable boards,
         as well as a firmware model for automatic device discovery, and a software API for interacting with the system.
  </li>

  <li>Q: Why create a new standard? Why not just use Arduino, or Beaglebone, or one of the many others?</li>
  <li><b>thingSoC</b> standardizes several new capabilities that the existing ones lack, and is a completely open source
         standard, not tied any particular vendor implementation, CPU architecture, or IDE. <br>
         <b>thingSoC</b> is also designed to be backward compatible with 
         Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, X-Bee, and many others.
  </li>

  <li>Q: How big are the <b>thingSoC</b> modules?
  </li>
  <li><b>thingSoC</b> modules come in standardized sizes with specificed mounting hole pattern.<br>
      A <b>single thingSoC</b> module is  38.1mm long by 38.1mm wide (1.5 inches x 1.5 inches).<br>
      A <b>double thingSoC</b> module is  79.2mm long by 38.1mm wide (3.12 inches x 1.5 inches). <br>
      A <b>triple thingSoC</b> module is 114.8mm long by 38.1mm wide (4.52 inches x 1.5 inches). <br>
      <b>thingSoC</b> modules can have different I/O connector type "bindings", in order
      to facilitate specific user requirements. The "default <b>thingSoC</b> I/O connector binding" is
      the "BreadBoard" type, which employs common 2.54mm (0.1 inch) female header and male pin connections. 
  </li>

  <li>Q: How many pins do <b>thingSoC</b> modules have?
  </li>
  <li><b>thingSoC</b> modules can be from a minumum of six(6) pins to a maximum of eighty(80) pins per 
      <b>thingSoC</b> socket. The <b>thingSoC</b> module pin configurations are <br>
      <ul>
        <li>6 Pins - The minimum IOClass includes Vin, Vbat, 5V, Ground, I2C1_SDA, and I2C1_SCL, to form
            a bare minimum connection. The I2C bus is used for both configuration information and data exchange.</li>
        <li>20 Pins - adds UART and SPI bus pins for higher speed data exchange, 
            as well as additional clocks, interrupt and power saving shutdown modes.</li>
        <li>40 Pins - adds USB2.0, JTAG, Analog, and I2S audio.</li>
        <li>80 Pins - add Superspeed USB3.0, PCI-E, or 10/100 Ethernet, second UART, Second SPI ports.</li>
      </ul>
