  <h1>RSVP-SIS Shipping Policy</h1>
  
  <h3>General Shipping Policy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We charge actual shipping costs plus a $4.95 handling charge. 
    </li>
    <li>
      We ship via the United States Postal Service (USPS), Federal Express(FedEx), and United Parcel Service(UPS). We do not use any other shipping services at the current time. 
    </li>
    <li>
      FedEx and UPS will not deliver to Post Office (PO) Boxes. If your shipping address is a PO Box, then please select USPS as your shipping option, or your package may be returned to us at your expense.
    </li>
    <li>
      All of our orders are shipped "Signature Not Required" by default, but the shipping company may decide to require a signature depending on the declared value of the shipment, or the destination address (particularly around Christmas, when some areas have had a large number of missing packages...). If you desire your order to be sent with "Signature Required", please contact Customer Service. If a "Signature Not Required" package is to be left at the address, but the package is not there when you get home, neither RSVP-SIS nor the shipper can be held responsible.
    </li>
    <li>
      We will fill all orders as soon as possible. If an item is out-of-stock, or backordered, we will ship the remainder of your order, and inform you of the out-of-stock, or backordered items via email. You will only be charged for the items that are available and shipped. Once your order is ready to ship, a Shipping Confirmation email, with tracking information (if applicable), will be sent.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Please Note:</strong> Priority and First Class Mail packages are <strong>NOT</strong> insured. In the case a package is lost or damaged in transit, RSVP-SIS will not be held responsible for replacing the order.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any duties and taxes for international shipments are the responsibility of the customer. RSVP-SIS is not responsible for any extra charges once the original package has been shipped. If the customer refuses to pay these extra charges, the return shipping and any additional fees will be taken out of the cost of the order, with any remaining funds being refunded to the customer.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Shipping Costs</h3>
  <p>
    RSVP-SIS calculates actual shipping costs during checkout. If you would like an estimate of shipping charges before checkout, then please add the items you intend to order to your cart, and select the "calculate shipping" button from the Shopping Cart page. This will provide a list of estimates for the shipping methods available to your selected destination. By default, the shipping is calculated using USPS "Priority" mail. You may select other options during checkout.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have your own FedEx or UPS account, you may choose to use your own account to cover any shipping charges for your order. To use your own shipping account, enter your account number in the shipping account field during checkout. We will then charge only our standard handling fee, and we will submit the shipping charges to your own account.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Please note:</strong> Your own contract shipping rates may vary from our rates. The shipping estimate you see in your checkout cart will have no relation to what you will actually be billed when using your own shipping account. Please do not enter your FedEx or UPS account number unless you are certain that you want to ship on your own account instead of ours.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Special Handling</h3>
  <p>
    If you requiure any special handling, plase contact Customer Service directly.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Minimum Orders</h3>
  <p>
    RSVP-SIS does not have any minimum order size or monetary amount; 
    however, certain items may only come in specific lot sizes (i.e. a strip of five "5", for example).
  </p>
  
  <h3>Sales Tax</h3>
  <p>
    All Items are shipped FOB Portland, OR. The State of Oregon does not charge Sales Tax.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Gift Certificates</h3>
  <p>
    Gift Certificates are sent from the Gifter to the Giftee directly by email. 
    We do not send out any physical certificates. In order to send a Gift Certificate that you have purchased, please follow the "Send Gift Certificate" link.
