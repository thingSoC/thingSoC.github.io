      Are Licenses required to use RSVP-SIS Intellectual Property?

		 At the bottom of each Project page will be a section that describes the licensing for that particular project, article, or library.
		 We release most of our basic IP, Libraries, and How-To's under the Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 License terms.
		 We generally release our products for sale under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License terms.
		 If we have used IP or Code from another orgranization and need to honor their licensing terms, that will also be noted there as well.

          RSVP-SIS products for sale use the increasingly popular business model called "Dual Licensing" in which both the open source software distribution mechanism and traditional commercial software distribution models are combined.
        </li>
        <li><b>Open Source Projects:</b></li>
        <li>
          If you are developing and distributing non-commercial, open source applications under the Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 License terms, as published by the Creative Commons Foundation, then you are free to use the RSVP-SIS software under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. Please note that requires that all modifications to the original code as well as all Derivative Works must also be released under the same terms.
        </li>
        <li><b>Closed Source Projects:</b></li>
        <li>
          If you are developing and distributing traditional closed source or commercial applications, then you must purchase a RSVP-SIS commercial use license, which is specifically designed for users interested in retaining the proprietary status of their code. All RSVP-SIS commercial licenses expressly supersede the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. This means that when you license the RSVP-SIS software under a commercial license, you specifically do not use the software under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and therefore you are not subject to any of its terms.
