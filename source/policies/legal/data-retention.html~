  <h1>RSVP-SIS Data Retention Policy</h1>
  
  <p>
    These policies and guidelines are established for our users to clearly understand what information is retained by the RSVP-SIS Web Site and for what duration.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What is the RSVP-SIS Business?</h3>
  <p>
    RSVP-SIS is a manufacturer and reseller of educational electronic products, tools, and software components. We sell components, pieces, parts, and patterns that can assembled by our users to create many different types of electronic projects, according to the designs of our end-users.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What Information does RSVP-SIS collect about their Customers and Users?</h3>
  <p>
    User information is collected by RSVP-SIS in accordance with our 
    <a href="{{site.url.policies.privacy}}">Privacy Policy</a> and our 
    <a href="{{site.url.policies.termsofservice}}">Terms of Service</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the user profile information is in the public domain, strictly at the user's own choice, so anyone can see that information on the RSVP-SIS.com Web Site. A RSVP-SIS user profile may contain information and comments that the user themselves have posted, and at the user's choice, they may display a profile image of themselves. As part of the user's profile, the user has the choice to select an alias-name and other biographical data, such as their interests or location, for display on the RSVP-SIS Web Site, as a part of their public persona/profile. You may consult our <a href="{{site.url.policies.privacy}}">Privacy Policy</a> for more information on the types of information that we collect from our users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any public persona and profile information is a choice for the user to provide, and we do not require it. It is not verified in any way by RSVP-SIS, and may not be accurate.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Data Retention</h3>
  <p>
    RSVP-SIS is a <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/">PCI Compliant</a> Web Site, and as such, we do not retain any detailed credit card information. RSVP-SIS retains all customer supplied information, such as persona and profiles for the duration
    of the customer account, and at the customers choice, they may delete that data at any time, or delete their account completely at any time. Please consult our <a href="{{site.url.policies.termsofservice}}">Terms of Service</a> for other information.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Data Retention Durations</h3>

    and customer order records, receipts, etc. for the minimum time required to comply with <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/How-long-should-I-keep-records%3F">IRS guidelines</a>, for small business data retention.
