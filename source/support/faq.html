<h1>thingSoC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<ul class="faq">
  <li>Q: What is <b>thingSoC</b>?</li>
  <li>A: <b>thingSoC</b> is an open source standard that defines a
vendor independent socket system for the creation of new Internet Things;
it addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings
and standards, by adding capabilities such as automatic device discovery, 
automatic device configuration, self-monitoring, and self-testing.</li>

  <li>Q: Is <b>thingSoC</b> hardware, firmware, or software?
  </li>
  <li>A: <b>thingSoC</b> defines both a physical, hardware socket system for interoperable boards,
         as well as a firmware model for automatic device discovery, and a software API for interacting with the system.
  </li>

  <li>Q: Why create a new standard? Why not just use Arduino, or Beaglebone, or one of the many others?</li>
  <li>A: <b>thingSoC</b> standardizes several new capabilities that the existing ones lack, and is a completely open source
         standard, not tied any particular vendor implementation, CPU architecture, or IDE. <br>
         <b>thingSoC</b> is also designed to be backward compatible with 
         Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, X-Bee, and many others.
  </li>

  <li>Q: How big are the <b>thingSoC</b> modules?
  </li>
  <li>A: A "Single" <b>thingSoC</b> module is  38.1mm long by 38.1mm wide (1.5 inches x 1.5 inches).<br>
         A "Double" <b>thingSoC</b> module is  79.2mm long by 38.1mm wide (3.12 inches x 1.5 inches). <br>
         A "Triple" <b>thingSoC</b> module is 114.8mm long by 38.1mm wide (4.52 inches x 1.5 inches). <br>
