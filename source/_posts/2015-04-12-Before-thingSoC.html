<p>In order to really understand why the <b>thingSoC</b> platform was needed, 
you first need a little background on the previous generation of embedded development tools,
and small form factor microprocesor boards.

<h3>What is a Small Form Factor? </h3>
<p>
  Small Form Factor lacks a normative definition and is consequently open to (mis)interpretation and/or misuse.
  It historically referred to any (PC) computer format that was smaller than a traditional tower computer,
  and was applied to any smaller computer, such as shoebox size (Shuttle), small cubes, net-tops and book sized computers.
</p>
<p>
 For the purposes of discussion today, we will define a Small Form Factor as,
 any computing device, or circuit board, that is smaller than the Standard ATX motherboard,
 meaning smaller than 12.00 by 9.65 inches (305mm by 244mm).
</p>
<h3>Trends in Small Form Factors for Embedded Devices</h3>
<p>
  There are two primary trends in Small Form Factor adoption today, and those break down
  along the lines of quasi-Proprietary standards versus Open Source Hardware standards.
  Companies like Texas Instruments have adopted quasi-Proprietary standards, such as the 
  <a href="http://www.ti.com/launchpad/">TI LaunchPad</a> and the 
  <a href="http://beagleboard.org/">BeagleBoard</a>, 
  which are used primarily to market and support their proprietary microprocessor/microcontroller products. 
  While other companies like Atmel, Freescale, and Cypress Semiconductor have embraced
  Open Source Hardware platforms such as the
  <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> family of small form factor boards. 
  The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> was developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation
  with the intention of providing a low cost platform for teaching basic computer science in schools.
  Other vendors like NXP, have embraced a more breadboard friendly Dual-Inline-Package (DIP) format,
  and have been having great success with their "mbed" format for small embedded processors.

<p>
Each of these <b>Small Form Factors</b> are popular for use with their companion microcontroller/microprocessor family brands,
and each have different stenghths and weaknesses. Between the design work done by <a href="http://www.moxondesign.com/">Moxon Design</a>
and <a href="http://www.patternagents.com/">PatternAgents</a> over the past twenty (20) years, we've used all of these platforms.
In the next article, we'll talk more about those strengths and weaknesses, and why <a href="https://github.com/thingSoC/">thingSoC</a>
needed to be built.
