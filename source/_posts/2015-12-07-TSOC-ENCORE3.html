The <b>TSOC-ENCORE3</b> board is a USB to PSOC1 (Progammable System on Chip) Base Board Reference Design.
It provides a complete thingSoC socket interface, including a full serial uart channel, I2C master channel, and SPI master channel with four (4) chip selects. 
The <b>TSOC-ENCORE3</b> board is based on the Cypress Semiconductor <a href="http://www.cypress.com/file/134346/download">CY7C64215</a>, a USB Programmable System on Chip.

The Cypress Semiconductor <a href="http://www.cypress.com/file/134346/download">CY7C64215</a> 
(or enCoRe III processor) is based on the flexible PSoC1 architecture and
is a full-featured, full-speed (12-Mbps) USB part. Configurable
analog, digital, and interconnect circuitry enable a high level of
integration in a host of consumer, and communication
applications.
<p>
This architecture enables the user to create customized
peripheral configurations that match the requirements of each
individual application. Additionally, a fast CPU, flash program
memory, SRAM data memory, and configurable I/O are included
