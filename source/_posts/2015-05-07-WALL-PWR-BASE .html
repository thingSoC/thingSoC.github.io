    <b>thingSoC Reference Design</b><br> 
    WALL-PWR-BASE is a an example PSoC 4200 Series, System on Chip, BASE module, a thingSoC reference design.

  </p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
WALL-PWR-BASE includes a dual channel USB to Serial interface, along with an I2C EEPROM (internal) for storing the board configuration information,
and status LED's. The WALL-PWR-BASE also includes VIN, USB, and Battery powered capabilities, with a single cell Li-Po battery charger.
The battery can be charged from either VIN (i.e. 12 volt wall wart) or the USB input.
<p> 
  <h3>WALL-PWR-BASE Features :</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard EEPROM for Car Model Identification</li>
    <li>Standard DC Barrel Jack for 12V input</li>
    <li>Battery (Single Cell Li-Po) Eliminator (supplies 4.2V)</li>
    <li>USB Charging/Power Jack Output (i.e. 12V/Car Battery Adaptor) </li>
    <li>Power Status LED's : Three (3)</li>
    <li>Manual Reset Button</li>
    <li>Real-Time Clock Oscillator (32,768 Hz)</li>
    <li>Referance Clock Oscliaator (7.73728 MHz)</li>
    <li>thingSoC BB-40-Double Form Factor</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>WALL-PWR-BASE is a simple, Wall Wart (12V brick) powered BASE implementation for powering thingSoC sockets.
There are many ways to power thingSoC modules, this is the one you need if you want a 
higher voltage (12Vdc -15Vdc) input for powering your thingSoC modules.
Complete design files are available using the links to the right.

   <b>thingSoC Reference Designs</b> are example thingSoC implementations that implement
   various reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
   These reference designs can serve as starting templates for user designs.
