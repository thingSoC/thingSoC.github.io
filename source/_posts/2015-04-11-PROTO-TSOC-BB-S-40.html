  <p>
    PROTO-TSOC-BB-S-40 is a simple is a simple Prototyping Board <b>thingSoC Reference Design</b>. 
  <p>
   <b>thingSoC Reference Designs</b> are example thingSoC implementations that implement
   various reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
   These reference designs can serve as starting templates for user designs.
