<p>
<b>thingSoC</b> is an open source project that defines a
vendor independent system socket standard for the creation of new devices
for the Internet of Things. 
<b>thingSoC</b> addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings;
such as automatic device discovery, automatic device configuration,
self-monitoring and self-testing capabilities. 
<br><br>
<b>thingSoC</b> can support many existing hardware small form factors,
such as Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglbone, X-Bee, and others;
but adds  new features and capabilites to make building
your IoT devices easier, with a more reliable and portable final product. 
<br><br>
<b>thingSoC</b> provides a vendor neutral and device agnostic socket standard,
using a virtual hardware definition. This means that the IoT applications you
develop can be easily migrated without having to re-write your software.
<br>

<p>
<b>thingSoC</b> firmware is based on the Reference System Virtual Platform (RSVP-SIS),
a virtual platform definition that supports a number of different System-on-Chip platforms.
