    <b>thingSoC Reference Design</b><br> 
    P4-BASE is a an example PSoC 4200 Series, System on Chip, thingSoC BASE Module.

  </p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
P4-BASE includes a dual channel USB to Serial interface, along with an I2C EEPROM (internal) for storing the board configuration information,
and status LED's. The P4-BASE also includes VIN, USB, and Battery powered capabilities, with a single cell Li-Po battery charger.
The battery can be charged from either VIN (i.e. 12 volt wall wart) or the USB input.

   <b>thingSoC Reference Designs</b> are example thingSoC implementations that implement
   various reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
   These reference designs can serve as starting templates for user designs.
