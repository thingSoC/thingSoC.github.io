  <h1>RSVP-SIS Technical Support</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to our Technical Support Pages.
  </p>
	<p>
    We want to provide you the best support possible for your RSVP-SIS products. We are happy to help you resolve any questions you may have with our products, but we first ask you to read our FAQs, before contacting Technical Support. Technical Support is generally limited to ensuring that your product is operating correctly.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{site.url.support.faq}}">Technical Support FAQ</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{site.url.policies.returns}}">Product Returns</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you have other questions about a particular application or require other development assisitance, such as: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>"How do I design a widget that does X?"</li>
    <li>"The software I wrote gives me a compile time error, can you help me debug it?"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We are happy to provide those types of customized support services for a reasonable fee.
  </p>
  <p>
    In all cases we prefer that you contact us first via email, and we will follow up with a telphone call if we need more information.
  </p>
