<h1>thingSoC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<ul class="faq">
  <li>Q: What is <b>thingSoC</b>?</li>
  <li><b>thingSoC</b> is an open source standard that defines a
vendor independent socket system for the creation of new Internet Things;
it addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings
and standards, by adding capabilities such as automatic device discovery, 
automatic device configuration, self-monitoring, and self-testing.</li>

  <li>Q: Is <b>thingSoC</b> hardware, firmware, or software?
  </li>
  <li><b>thingSoC</b> defines both a physical, hardware socket system for interoperable boards,
         as well as a firmware model for automatic device discovery, and a software API for interacting with the system.
  </li>

  <li>Q: Why create a new standard? Why not just use Arduino, or Beaglebone, or one of the many others?</li>
  <li><b>thingSoC</b> standardizes several new capabilities that the existing ones lack, and is a completely open source
         standard, not tied to any particular vendor implementation, CPU architecture, or IDE. <br>
         <b>thingSoC</b> is also designed to be backward compatible with 
         Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, X-Bee, and many others.
  </li>

  <li>Q: How big are the <b>thingSoC</b> modules?
  </li>
  <li><b>thingSoC</b> modules come in standardized sizes with specificed mounting hole patterns.<br>
      A <b>single thingSoC</b> module is  38.1mm long by 38.1mm wide (1.5 inches x 1.5 inches).<br>
      A <b>double thingSoC</b> module is  79.2mm long by 38.1mm wide (3.12 inches x 1.5 inches). <br>
      A <b>triple thingSoC</b> module is 114.8mm long by 38.1mm wide (4.52 inches x 1.5 inches). <br>
      The default sizes have been chosen as a best compromise between cost, ease of assembly and ease of use.
      They have also been chosen to be compatible with a wide variety of existing packaging options.
  </li>

  <li>Q: How many pins do <b>thingSoC</b> modules have?
  </li>
  <li>
       <b>thingSoC</b> modules can have different I/O connector type "bindings", in order
      to facilitate specific user requirements. The default <b>thingSoC</b> I/O connector binding is
      the "BreadBoard" type, which employs common 2.54mm pitch (0.1 inch) female header and male pin connections,
      and as the name suggests, is capable of being used with 2.54mm pitch breadboards and prototyping boards.
      <br><br>
      <b>thingSoC</b> modules can be from a minimum of six(6) pins to a maximum of eighty(80) pins per 
      individual socket. The <b>thingSoC</b> module pin configurations are <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>6 Pins</b> - The Minimum PinClass (0)<br>
            includes Vin, Vbat, 5V, Ground, I2C1_SDA, and I2C1_SCL, to form a bare minimum connection. 
            The I2C bus is used for both configuration information and data exchange.</li>
        <li><b>20 Pins</b> - The Basic PinClass (1)<br>
            adds UART and SPI bus pins for higher speed data exchange, 
            as well as additional clocks, interrupt and power saving shutdown modes.</li>
        <li><b>40 Pins</b> - The Standard Pinclass (2)<br>
            adds USB2.0, JTAG, Analog, and I2S audio.</li>
        <li><b>80 Pins</b> - The Maximum PinClass (3)<br>
            adds Superspeed USB3.0, PCI-E, or 10/100 Ethernet, second UART, Second SPI ports.</li>
      </ul>
      
  </li>

  <li>Q: What does <b>thingSoC</b> mean by the terms "Compliant" and "Compatible" devices?
  </li>
  <li> <b>thingSoC Compliant</b> devices implement at least the the Minimum PinClass (0) of six (6) pins, 
       and the <b>thingSoC</b> EEPROM based autodiscovery mechanism in a <b>thingSoC</b> single, double, or triple sized PCB,
       with specified mounting holes. <br>
       <b>thingSoC Compatible</b> devices may fit and interoperate with <b>thingSoC</b> based systems,
       but do not support the <b>thingSoC</b> EEPROM based autodiscovery mechanism or match the physical PCB size and specified mounting holes.
       This implies that <b>thingSoC Compatible</b> devices don't have access to <b>thingSoC</b> extended functions.
