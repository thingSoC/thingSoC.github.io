The <b>TSOC-XMC1200</b> board is an Infineon XMC1200 CPU Base Board Reference Design.
It provides a complete eight (8) pin full UART connection as well as the popular six (6) pin "FTDI" connector
that is compatible with Arduino and many other development boards. The <b>TSOC-XMC1200</b> board is based on the 
 <a href="http://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-xmc1200-DS-v01_04-EN.pdf">Infineon XMC1200</a>, an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller.
