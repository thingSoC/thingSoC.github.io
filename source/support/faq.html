<h1>thingSoC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<ul class="faq">
  <li>Q: What is thingSoC?</li>
  <li>thingSoC is an open source standard that defines a
vendor independent socket system for the creation of new Internet Things;
it addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings
and standards, by adding capabilities such as automatic device discovery, 
automatic device configuration, self-monitoring, and self-testing.</li>

  <li>Q: Is thingSoC hardware, firmware, or software?
  </li>
  <li>thingSoC defines both a physical, hardware socket system for interoperable boards,
         as well as a firmware model for automatic device discovery, and a software API for interacting with the system.
  </li>

  <li>Q: Why create a new standard? Why not just use Arduino, or Beaglebone, or one of the many others?</li>
  <li>thingSoC standardizes several new capabilities that the existing ones lack, and is a completely open source
         standard, not tied to any particular vendor implementation, CPU architecture, or IDE. <br>
         thingSoC is also designed to be backward compatible with 
         Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, X-Bee, and many others.
  </li>

  <li>Q: How big are the thingSoC modules?
  </li>
  <li>thingSoC modules come in standardized sizes with specified mounting hole patterns.<br>
      A <b>single thingSoC</b> module is  38.1mm long by 38.1mm wide (1.5 inches x 1.5 inches).<br>
      A <b>double thingSoC</b> module is  79.2mm long by 38.1mm wide (3.12 inches x 1.5 inches). <br>
      A <b>triple thingSoC</b> module is 114.8mm long by 38.1mm wide (4.52 inches x 1.5 inches). <br>
      The default sizes have been chosen as a best compromise between cost, ease of assembly and ease of use.
      They have also been chosen to be compatible with a wide variety of existing packaging options.

  </li>

  <li>Q: How many pins do thingSoC modules have?
  </li>
  <li>
       thingSoC modules can have different I/O connector type "bindings", in order
      to facilitate specific user requirements. The default thingSoC I/O connector binding is
      the "BreadBoard" type, which employs common 2.54mm pitch (0.1 inch) female header and male pin connections,
      and as the name suggests, is capable of being used with 2.54mm pitch breadboards and prototyping boards.
      <br><br>
      thingSoC modules can be from a minimum of six(6) pins to a maximum of eighty(80) pins per 
      individual socket. The thingSoC module pin configurations are :<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>6 Pins</b> - The Minimum PinClass (0)<br>
            includes Vin, Vbat, 5V, Ground, I2C1_SDA, and I2C1_SCL, to form a bare minimum connection. 
            The I2C bus is used for both configuration information and data exchange.</li>
        <li><b>20 Pins</b> - The Basic PinClass (1)<br>
            adds UART and SPI bus pins for higher speed data exchange, 
            as well as additional clocks, interrupt and power saving shutdown control pins.</li>
        <li><b>40 Pins</b> - The Standard Pinclass (2)<br>
            adds USB2.0, JTAG, Analog, and I2S audio.</li>
        <li><b>80 Pins</b> - The Maximum PinClass (3)<br>
            adds Superspeed USB3.0, PCI-E, or 10/100 Ethernet, second UART, Second SPI ports.</li>
      </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Q: What do the terms "thingSoC Compliant" and "thingSoC Compatible" mean?
  </li>
  <li> <b>thingSoC Compliant</b> devices implement at least the the Minimum PinClass (0) of six (6) pins, 
       and the thingSoC EEPROM based autodiscovery mechanism in a thingSoC single, double, or triple sized PCB,
       with specified mounting holes, and display the thingSoC logo on the silkscreen. 
       <br><br>
       <b>thingSoC Compatible</b> devices may fit and interoperate with thingSoC based systems,
       but do not support the thingSoC EEPROM based autodiscovery mechanism or match the physical PCB size and specified mounting holes.
       This implies that <b>thingSoC Compatible</b> devices don't have access to thingSoC extended functions or display the thingSoC logo. 
  </li>

  <li>Q: Is the thingSoC autodiscovery mechanism compatible with the Beaglebone Cape Manager?
  </li>
  <li> Yes. <b>thingSoC Compliant</b> devices implement the thingSoC EEPROM based autodiscovery mechanism,
       which is compatible with the <A href="http://elinux.org/BeagleBone_and_the_3.8_Kernel#Cape_Manager_requirements">Linux 3.8 Kernal 
       and Device  Tree  Overlays</a>. The thingSoC EEPROM based autodiscovery mechanism also implements additional features,
       however it is backward compatible with the Linux Beaglebone Cape Manager.
