<h2>About thingSoC</h2>
<p>
<b>thingSoC</b> is a modular development platform for the Internet of Things,
that addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings;
such as automatic device discovery, automatic device configuration,
self-monitoring and self-testing capabilities. 
<br><br>
<b>thingSoC</b> can support existing XBee format radios,
but adds many new features and capabilites that make designing
your next IoT device much easier and more reliable. 
<br><br>
<b>thingSoC</b> provides a vendor neutral and device agnostic hardware platform,
using a virtual hardware platform definition. This means that the IoT applications you
develop can be easily migrated without having to re-write your software.
