The <b>TSOC-USBUART1</b> board is a single channel, USB to UART Base Board Reference Design.
It provides a complete eight (8) pin full UART connection as well as the popular six (6) pin "FTDI" connector
that is compatible with Arduino and many other development boards. The <b>TSOC-USBUART1</b> board is based on the Cypress Semiconductor <a href="http://www.cypress.com/file/139881/download">CY7C65213</a>, a USB to UART Bridge Controller.

<br><br>
The Cypress Semiconductor <a href="http://www.cypress.com/file/139881/download">CY7C65213</a> is a fully integrated USB-to-UART bridge that
provides a simple method to upgrade UART-based devices to
USB with a minimal number of components. The <a href="http://www.cypress.com/file/139881/download">CY7C65213</a>
includes a USB 2.0 Full-Speed controller, a UART transceiver,
an internal regulator, an internal oscillator, and a 512-byte flash
in a 32-pin QFN and 28-pin SSOP package.
The internal flash is used to store custom-specific USB
descriptors and GPIO configuration. This is done in-system
using a configuration utility that communicates over the USB
interface.
Cypress Semiconductor provides royalty-free Virtual COM Port (VCP) device
drivers. The drivers allow the device to appear as a COM port in
PC applications. All UART signals, including handshaking and
control signals, are implemented.
