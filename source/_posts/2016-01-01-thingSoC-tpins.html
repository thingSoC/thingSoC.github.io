<p><b>thingSoC</b> has a new, but simple method for determining the multiplexing of Input/Output Pins
for add-on boards and peripherals. Remember that the Linux Device Tree pin multiplexing information is
provided to control the pin multiplexing on the CPU or microcontroller itself; and doesn't necessarily specify
all the information about a specific peripheral pin multiplexing or it's capabilities. <br><b>thingSoC</b> has a few simple bus
configurations that make interfacing peripherals a snap.

<h3>thingSoC Pin Configurations</h3>
<p>
<b>thingSoC</b> is different from the other 'lil microprocessor boards out there, such as the Arduino Mini, NXP mBed, Teensy, and others;
it has defined pin configurations that are cross-platform compatible. In other words, all thingSoC compatible boards use an interchangeable
interconnection scheme, even if the embedded microprocessor is a different make or model. The example below shows how this is possible :

</p> 
<p>
Most Microprocessor busses, such as SPI, or I2S audio, have a grouping of particular signals that are needed to implement that particular bus type.
The <b>thingSoC</b> specification requires those signal groupings on specific pins, so the particular signals you need, are always located where you need them to be.
This insures interoperability across a wide range of peripherals and add-on boards.
</p>
<h3>thingSoC Minimum Pin Configuration</h3>
<p>
The minimum <b>thingSoC</b> socket configuration is only four (4) pins, namely, Power(5V), Ground, I2C_SDA, and I2C_SCL.
This allows the <b>thingSoC</b> socket controller to read the socket configuration information 
(at I2C Address 0x54 - 0x57), in order to determine how a programmable <b>thingSoC</b> socket 
is configured.
</p>

</p> 
<p>
Once the <b>thingSoC</b> socket controller reads the socket configuration table via the I2C interface, it can configure the remainder of the
socket connections corrrectly for the specific attached peripheral. For example, in an configuration that requires a large number of analog
sensor inputs to be sampled, all the remaining pins might be configured to be Analog inputs, as the following example shows :

</p>

<h3>thingSoC Default Pin Configuration</h3>
<p>The <b>thingSoC</b> socket default configuration
is shown below, and includes, one I2C interace (minimum), one full UART interface (eight pins), one full SPI interface (ten pins),
and JTAG/Programming interface (eight pins).

</p>
<p>
The <b>thingSoC</b> socket pin configurations are one of the features of the <b>thingSoC</b> architecture that allow for simple operation
and great interoperability between different microprocessor makes and models. In the next article, we'll cover the <b>thingSoC</b> socket 
JTAG and Programming Interface, a dual mode interface that saves a number of pins during normal operating modes.

<h3>thingSoC Resources</h3>
<p>
<b>thingSoC</b> defines a physical, hardware socket system for inter-operable printed circuit boards,
with a data centric firmware model for automatic device discovery, and a software API for interacting with the system.
