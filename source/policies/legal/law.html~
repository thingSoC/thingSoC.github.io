    RSVP-SIS is a manufacturer and reseller of educational electronic products, tools, and software components. We sell components, pieces, parts, and patterns that can assembled by our users to create many different types of electronic projects, according to the designs of our end-users.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What Information does RSVP-SIS have about their Customers and Users?</h3>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the user profile information is in the public domain, strictly at the user's own choice, so anyone can see that information on the RSVP-SIS.com Web Site. A RSVP-SIS user profile may contain information and comments that the user themselves have posted, and at the user's choice, they may display a profile image of themselves. As part of the user's profile, the user has the choice to select an alias-name and other biographical data, such as their interests or location, for display on the RSVP-SIS Web Site, as a part of their public persona/profile. You may consult our <a href="{{site.url.policies.privacy}}">Privacy Policy</a> for more information on the types of information that we collect from our users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any public persona and profile information is a choice for the user to provide, and we do not require it. It is not verified in any way by RSVP-SIS, and may not be accurate.
