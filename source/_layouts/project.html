layout: basic
# we need to do this with a layout in _layouts instead of
# one in _include/layouts (like every other page), because
# post.content gets used in news/index.html, and it needs
# to be just the post content, not the page headers & etc.

{% capture standard_content %}
  <h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

  <!-- Add the content from the post/project -->
  {{content}}

{% endcapture %}

<!-- Add the standard layout -->
{% include layouts/project_std.html %}
