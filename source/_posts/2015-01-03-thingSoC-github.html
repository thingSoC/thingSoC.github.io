<!-- more -->
<p>
<b>thingSoC</b> is an open source project that defines a
vendor independent system socket standard for the creation of new devices
for the Internet of Things. 
<b>thingSoC</b> addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings;
such as automatic device discovery, automatic device configuration,
self-monitoring and self-testing capabilities.

<b>thingSoC</b> can support many existing hardware small form factors,
such as Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglbone, X-Bee, and others;
but adds  new features and capabilites to make building
your IoT devices easier, with a more reliable and portable final product.
