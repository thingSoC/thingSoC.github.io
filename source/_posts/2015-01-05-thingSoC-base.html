<p>
<b>thingSoC</b> is a modular development platform for the Internet of Things,
that addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings;
such as automatic device discovery, automatic device configuration,
self-monitoring and self-testing capabilities. 
<br><br>
<b>thingSoC</b> can support existing hardware small form factors, like
Xbee, Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, and others;
but adds  new features and capabilites to make building
your next IoT device much easier, with a more reliable final product. 
<br><br>
<b>thingSoC</b> provides a vendor neutral and device agnostic hardware platform,
using a virtual hardware platform definition. This means that the IoT applications you
develop can be easily migrated without having to re-write your software.
</p>

<p>
<b>thingSoC</b> firmware is based on the Reference System Virtual Platform (RSVP-SIS),
a virtual platform definition that supports a number of different System-on-Chip platforms. 
</p>
