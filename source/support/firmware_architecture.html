<ul class="faq">
  <li>Q: What is thingSoC firmware?</li>
  <li>All <b>thingSoC Compliant</b> boards contain an I2C EEPROM Memory device (minimum 32Kbits)
      which contains data that identifies the board type, it's serial number, pin multiplexing
      and setup information. THis allows a <b>thingSoC Compliant</b> system to automatically discover
      what boards have been installed into a system, and to configure itself properly to communicate with them.
  </li>

  <li>Q: Is the thingSoC firmware autodiscovery mechanism compatible with the Beaglebone Cape Manager?
  </li>
  <li> Yes. <b>thingSoC Compliant</b> devices implement the thingSoC EEPROM based autodiscovery mechanism,
       which is compatible with the <A href="http://elinux.org/BeagleBone_and_the_3.8_Kernel#Cape_Manager_requirements">Linux 3.8 Kernal 
       and Device  Tree  Overlays</a>. The thingSoC EEPROM based autodiscovery mechanism also implements additional features,
       however it is backward compatible with the Linux Beaglebone Cape Manager.
